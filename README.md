# React Pictures Search

React pictures search app as part of Stephen Grider's Modern React with Redux course on Udemy, that I'm following as part of my path to learn React.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js
- NPM
- Unsplash Developer account

### How to start the app for development

- Set the `REACT_APP_UNSPLASH_ACCESS_KEY` environment variable to your unsplash access key.
- Run `npm i` to install the dependencies.
- Start the app with `npm start` (runs the app in the development mode). The page will reload when you make changes. You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### How to test the app

- Run `npm test`.

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### How to build the app

- Run `npm run build`.

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
